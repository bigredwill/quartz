## Why I chose this van
- compact
	- It is the length of a Toyota Prius, so can fit in a city spot.
	- It is under 7' tall, so can fit in a parking garage.
- tall interior
	- There is enough space where surfboards can be strapped to the ceiling on the interior, and I can comfortably exist in the van.  They are pushed to one side, while I can sit up comfortably on the other. Sleeping is no problem.
- stealthy
	- It does not have the exterior look of a camper van, just a small city van. 
	- The window's are tinted, and I have covers on the interior. I have a dark blackout curtain between the front seats and the rear. This has the result of eliminatiing light leaks in both directions.
- modern
	- though, was not as reliable as I thought it would be, and was harder to do my own work on it.
	- cruise control
	- air conditioning

## Camper van build 
### Iterations
The interior of the van has gone through several iterations.

#### Crap hauler
At times it was empty - used to haul plywood and skateboard ramps, people, bikes, trash, and furniture.

#### Mars College build out
This iteration was built for Mars college. I thought I wanted a passageway from back to front. While it looks nice, it was quite cramped. I am a larger person so the bed was too narrow for me. Additionally, I did not find myself needing or using the rear door to get in or access things.

## The Reality of motor vehicle maintenance
I bought this in May 2020. I rode my bike to the used car dealership and drove off with it. I likely overpaid for the vehicle, but it was there and I was ready, and how bad could a 35k mile vehicle be?

Well, I ended up getting towed twice, various repairs, and an engine top-side rebuild.  I tried to do as much as I could on my own, but the 2012 being a newer car, everything was compact and complex to access. Here's a few issues I had.

### Clunking sound
The car made a bad clunking sound whenever it went over a bump. I narrowed it down to sway bar bushings by grabbing the sway bar and shaking it. I was relieved to find that the part was less than 20\$. To my dismay, the replacement would require detaching the steering wheel linkage and dropping the front subframe, of which I could not accomplish with the small jack stands I had access to. The shop time to fix was 1.5 hours at a labor cost of 160\$ an hour.

### Coolant hose woes - blown engine
In Seattle, driving down the freeway, I look at the dash and the oil temp is High. Wtf? I pull over, and turn off the car. What could this be? I get a tow truck (not AAA, as they won't tow my small van...) and go to the mechanic. The engine had overheated because a coolant hose blew off on the freeway, dumping all the coolant to the ground. The head needed to be rebuilt. Another couple grand was cheaper than a new car, so I went for the repair.  The car has been running great ever since, stronger than ever.
