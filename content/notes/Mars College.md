[Mars College](https://mars.college/) is a high-tech low-cost art residency in the desert by the Salton Sea in California. It takes place January through March. I attended for the first time in 2023.

There are a variety of archetypes that attend Mars, all are somewhat nerdy, all are somewhat sensitive, and all have a curiosity towards the unknown.

Mars takes place in a harsh environment. There are 40mph wind-storms that kick up dust and debris - we caught a mattress rolling through the desert. There are scorpions, and horse-flies, and regular flies too. Water is important, and naturally scarce, but locally abundant. Thus, shelter is important.

Folks live in a variety of places: some in our vans (I lived in a [[notes/2012 Ford Transit Connect|2012 Ford Transit Connect]]), some in tents, some in RVs and trailers, some on a simple mattress in the middle of the tire circle, and some in the small town of Bombay Beach that is only a mile away.


### Future Mars Ideas
- Build a ___ to live in for Mars College
	- box-truck apartment
		1. It will have the roll up back door, that achieves two things:
		2. A 3 or 4 foot porch, that allows for hanging out off the desert floor
		3. The ability to be closed off when away.
	- trailer tiny home
		1. build it on a harbor-freight trailer
		2. Small, light-weight, self contained
		3. Use recycled materials to build exterior
		4. Make plans, so many could be built?
			5. People like having their own living situation, so a small trailer might fit that bill.
- Skate ramps
	- build some wooden ramps for the kids in town
	- build some concrete diy on the beach
	- build a secrete ramp far out
- Live coding
	- Join the live coding club
- DJ
	- Continue learning to dj
- Sculpture art
