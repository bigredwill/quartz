> Work - in this note I refer to art, projects, ideas, as work.

The desire to do good work comes from some idea of what good work is. This desire can often stifle or prevent us from doing any work. 

We see finely polished works from professionals every day. Social media shows us mostly finely curated works by people we know. We don't often see the progress shots or bad finished pieces. This influences our minds to think that no one else makes bad work.

Bad work is good. Bad work is just work that we deem not up to our standards. Let's be brave to be uneditorialized. Let's show our work, good or bad, or, likely, in between, and have the conversation about it.

Our lives are rarely perfect, so let's not pretend to be perfect by only releasing perfect work.
