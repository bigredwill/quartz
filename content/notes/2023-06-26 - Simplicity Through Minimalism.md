It's a played out trope - we don't own our things, our things own us. I have found that to be true. 

The things we own keep us in loops around them. We spend time and resources upkeeping them, storing them, and hopefully using them. Most things I own do not get used on a daily or even weekly basis.  Actually, at this point, most things I own do not get used on a monthly basis. I am hoping to release them from my ownership ASAP so that I can free my time for other things.

I live out of a tiny van right now, which means I cannot take a lot with me. I have returned to Seattle to sort through my things in storage. It is emotional to go through everything I own, and used to use. I have to get rid of them, because I do not see myself living in a longer term space in the US in the near future.

Minimalism is attractive to me right now. Being unashamed about wearing slightly dirty pants, or  wearing the same outfit to the gym day after day. 

Reduced ownership gives me peace of mind as well. Everything I own has a place and space. It is with me in the van, and I don't need to return anywhere to be comfortable at home. Home is where the van is in **Park**.
