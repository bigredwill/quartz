title: Yes I'm an addict

---

To recover I must admit: I am an addict. Specifically, content on screens.

Instagram is a vice, and so is online pornography. 

I know that it is related to dopamine circuitry.

I feel that these things get in the way of some normalcy in my life. Or, at least, create tension in the times where something needs to be done.

I've never not gotten my work done, but I feel that it prevents me from engaging deeper with my own creative work.

I feel that it prevents me from engaging deeper and more thoughtfully with my romantic relationships as well.
