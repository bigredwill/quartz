Periodic living - moving and staying, then moving and returning.

## Present State

January of 2023, I quit a full time job and moved out of an apartment. I packed lightly, jumped in my van, and hit the road south to [[notes/Mars College|Mars College]].  It's a periodic community in the desert, a high-tech low-cost art residency, a reprise from societal expectations, a portal in to new realities, life affirming, amongst other things.

Now it is May of 2023, and I am on the road north again towards Seattle. I left behind a small storage unit of household items, and a small workshop full of materials and a few tools. The plan is to sell, use, or give away most of these things. The rest is to come with me on the road.

I have a small van, a small white [[notes/2012 Ford Transit Connect]]. It is already packed pretty full, but could be fuller. A roof-top box and a trailer hitch will do the trick.

## Future State

The plan is to return to the desert at the end of the year. This time with more intention and steadfast desire - desire to make art, integrate with community, and build more than I ever have before.

I turn 30 years old in September. This new decade of my life brings plenty of questions: why am I here? How do I spend my time and energy? With whom do I commune? I exit the second decade of my life with some answers too: We are here to serve each other. We are capable. We can overcome adversity. We are powerful and sensitive beings who can attune our sensitive powers to achieve what we deem worthwhile.

I plan to make art in collaboration with others. I want to build things that spark joy, create spaces that bring comfort, and bring folks together in higher connection.

I plan to live periodically for a while - having spaces that we occupy and return to regularly. This is in conjuntion with the seasons, with what the weather dictates, and with where there is energy that draws me in.
