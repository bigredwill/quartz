This desire can often stifle or prevent us from doing any work. \n\nWe see finely polished works from professionals every day. Social media shows us mostly finely curated works by people we know. We don't often see the progress shots or bad finished pieces. This influences our minds to think that no one else makes bad work.\n\nBad work is good. Bad work is just work that we deem not up to our standards. Let's be brave to be uneditorialized. Let's show our work, good or bad, or, likely, in between, and have the conversation about it.\n\nOur lives are rarely perfect, so let's not pretend to be perfect by only releasing perfect work.\n\nInspiration for this post:\nhttps://austinkleon.com/2023/05/07/artists-must-be-allowed-to-make-bad-work/","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:28:45.00774711Z","tags":["process"]},"/notes/bagels-in-the-desert":{"title":"Make bagels in the desert","content":"\nHere is the recipe:\n[[recipes/bagels|bagels]]\n\n2023 Mars College\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:28:45.00774711Z","tags":[]},"/recipes/bagels":{"title":"Bagel recipe","content":"\u003e Bagels are not a dumpling - they are finished with dry heat.\n\u003e \tsource: https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/nocturnalist-gathering-the-dumpling-family/\n\n![[images/bagels-eden-remix-side.jpg]]\n*__Left:__ batch of homemade bagels. __Right:__ the left image remixed by [https://eden.art/](https://eden.art/)*\n\n\nI am on a bagel journey. Inspired by cultural tradition, love of bread and baking, and a tightening of the wallet. It's cheap relative to the 4 plus dollars required to go out for a simple bagel with cream cheese (shoutout to all you bagel makers, though, the public needs bagels.)\n\nThe recipe I use is simple. This post is to get it online and shareable from outside email. The recipe was shared by my father, who got it from some internet site.\n\n\u003e The biggest tip I have is to use good flour and ingredients. Good input == good output.\n\n\n\n## Recipe\n\n**Prep Time**:¬†20 min **Cook Time**:¬†20 min **Serves**:¬†Makes 8 medium-sized bagels\n\n### Preperation Overview\n1.

Eat\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: sticky; top: 0; background-color: white; padding: 10px;z-index:1;\"\u003e\n\n### **Ingredients**\n\n**2 teaspoons** / 6 g active dry yeast\n\n**4 ¬Ω teaspoons** granulated sugar\n\n**1 ¬º cups** / 300 ml warm water (you may need ¬± ¬º cup /60 ml more)\n\n**3 ¬Ω cups** / 440 g bread flour or high gluten flour (you may need up to 1/2 cup / 60g for kneading)\n\n**1 ¬Ω teaspoons** salt\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nOptional Toppings: Caraway seeds, cinnamon sugar, coarse salt, minced fresh garlic, minced fresh onion, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, or a mix of your favorite flavors.\n\n### **Preparation Steps**\n\n#### Make dough\n\n1. In `¬Ω cup /120ml` of the warm water, pour in the sugar and yeast.\n    - Do not stir. Let it sit for five minutes, and then stir the yeast and sugar mixture, until it all dissolves in the water  \n  \n2. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast and sugar mixture.  \n  \n3. Pour `1/3 cup / 80ml` of the remaining warm water into the well. Mix and stir in the rest of the water as needed.\n    - Depending on where you live, you may need to add anywhere from a couple tablespoons to about `¬º cup/60ml` of water. You want a moist and firm dough after you have mixed it.  \n  \n4. On a floured countertop, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.\n    - Try working in as much flour as possible to form a firm and stiff dough.  \n  \n#### Let Dough Rise\n5. Lightly brush a large bowl with oil and turn the dough to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp dish towel.\n    - **[Bake Later]** Put the bowl in the fridge. Take out 1.5 hours before baking. Follow [Bake Now] instruction.\n    - **[Bake Now]** Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size. Punch the dough down, and let it rest for another 10 minutes.  \n\n#### Pre-Shape of Dough\n6. Divide dough in to 8 equal pieces.\n    1. Shape each piece into a round.\n    2. Use the counter top and your palm to pull the dough in to tighter rounds. See [this video by ChainBaker at 00:52 on pre-shaping technique](https://youtu.be/VoxMz0_j7yw?t=52).\n    3. Let rounds rest on counter for a few minutes. Usually by the time you are done with the last one, the first is ready for final shaping.\n\n#### Final Shape of Dough\n7. Coat a finger in flour, and gently press your finger into the center of each dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about ‚Öì the diameter of the bagel and place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Repeat the same step with the remaining dough.  \n\n#### Cookie Sheet Rest\n8. After shaping the dough rounds and placing them on the cookie sheet, cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, \n  \n#### Prep for Bake\n9. Preheat oven to to 425¬∫F / 220¬∫C.\n\n#### Boil\n10. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Reduce the heat. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to lower the bagels into the water. Boil as many as you are comfortable with boiling. Once the bagels are in, it shouldn‚Äôt take too long for them to float to the top (a couple seconds). Let them sit there for 1 minute, and them flip them over to boil for another minute. Extend the boiling times to 2 minutes each, if you‚Äôd prefer a chewier bagel (results will give you a more New York Style bagel with this option).  \n  \n#### Add Toppings\n10. If you want to add toppings to your bagels, do so as you take them out of the water, you may use the ‚Äúoptional toppings‚Äù (listed below) to top the bagels and if you‚Äôre risky like me, make a combination of the toppings to top the bagels with. However, before hand, you will need to use an egg wash to get the toppings to stick before putting the bagels into the oven.  \n\n#### Bake em!\n11. Once all the bagels have boiled (and have been topped with your choice of toppings), transfer them to an oiled or parchment-lined baking sheet.  \n  \n12. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown (I usually err on the side of 20 minutes).  \n  \n13. Cool on a wire rack.\n\n#### Eat em!\n14. While they are in the oven, get your schmears and spreads and toppings ready. I like cream cheese, tomato, thinly sliced red onion, avocado, salt and pepper. Or just eat it with some butter. Or just by itself. Make sure to eat them while hot!\n\n#### Save em.\n15. When cooled, slice bagels in half, then put in freezer in a freezer safe bag/container. Reheat in toaster or oven when a bagel is needed.","lastmodified":"2023-05-16T19:28:45.011747272Z","tags":["food","bagels"]}}
