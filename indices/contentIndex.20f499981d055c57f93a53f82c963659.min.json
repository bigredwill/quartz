I rode my bike to the used car dealership and drove off with it. I likely overpaid for the vehicle, but it was there and I was ready, and how bad could a 35k mile vehicle be?\n\nWell, I ended up getting towed twice, various repairs, and an engine top-side rebuild.  I tried to do as much as I could on my own, but the 2012 being a newer car, everything was compact and complex to access. Here's a few issues I had.\n\n### Clunking sound\nThe car made a bad clunking sound whenever it went over a bump. I narrowed it down to sway bar bushings by grabbing the sway bar and shaking it. I was relieved to find that the part was less than 20\\$. To my dismay, the replacement would require detaching the steering wheel linkage and dropping the front subframe, of which I could not accomplish with the small jack stands I had access to. The shop time to fix was 1.5 hours at a labor cost of 160\\$ an hour.\n\n### Coolant hose woes - blown engine\nIn Seattle, driving down the freeway, I look at the dash and the oil temp is High. Wtf? I pull over, and turn off the car. What could this be? I get a tow truck (not AAA, as they won't tow my small van...) and go to the mechanic. The engine had overheated because a coolant hose blew off on the freeway, dumping all the coolant to the ground. The head needed to be rebuilt. Another couple grand was cheaper than a new car, so I went for the repair.  The car has been running great ever since, stronger than ever.\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T21:32:30.976885069Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Create":{"title":"create create create create create","content":"\n\u003cstyle\u003e\n\t.create {\n\tmax-width: 100%; max-height: 7em; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 20px\n\t}\n\u003c/style\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"create\"\u003e\n\nC R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E C R E A T E \n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eMan is that even what palpable means?\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eSometimes I forget what real tangible life is.

This desire can often stifle or prevent us from doing any work. \n\nWe see finely polished works from professionals every day. Social media shows us mostly finely curated works by people we know. We don't often see the progress shots or bad finished pieces. This influences our minds to think that no one else makes bad work.\n\nBad work is good. Bad work is just work that we deem not up to our standards. Let's be brave to be uneditorialized. Let's show our work, good or bad, or, likely, in between, and have the conversation about it.\n\nOur lives are rarely perfect, so let's not pretend to be perfect by only releasing perfect work.\n\nInspiration for this post:\nhttps://austinkleon.com/2023/05/07/artists-must-be-allowed-to-make-bad-work/","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T21:32:30.976885069Z","tags":["process"]},"/notes/Mars-College":{"title":"Mars College","content":"\n[Mars College](https://mars.college/) is a high-tech low-cost art residency in the desert by the Salton Sea in California.

There are 40mph wind-storms that kick up dust and debris - we caught a mattress rolling through the desert. There are scorpions, and horse-flies, and regular flies too. Water is important, and naturally scarce, but locally abundant. Thus, shelter is important.\n\nFolks live in a variety of places: some in our vans (I lived in a [[notes/2012 Ford Transit Connect|2012 Ford Transit Connect]]), some in tents, some in RVs and trailers, some on a simple mattress in the middle of the tire circle, and some in the small town of Bombay Beach that is only a mile away.\n\n\n### Future Mars Ideas\n- Build a ___ to live in for Mars College\n\t- box-truck apartment\n\t\t1.

One thing it lacks is a sidebar menu listing all content. Here I describe the process for reproducing this functionality in a minimal way.\n\n## Summary\nWe will configure a dropdown style menu like Obsidian has. It will not be automatically populated by file structure, but will be auto-populated by defining some frontmatter in your markdown files.\n\n## Demo\n![[images/sidebar-28.mp4|sidebar]]\n\n## Create `sidebar.html` partial template\nCreate the file: `layouts/partials/sidebar.html`\n\nWe use the [`\u003cdetails\u003e` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) to create a dropdown.\n\n```html\n{{- $page := .page }}\n{{- $menuID := .menuID }}\n\n{{- with index site.Menus $menuID }}\n  \u003cnav class=\"menu\"\u003e\n    \u003cul\u003e\n      {{- partial \"inline/menu/walk.html\" (dict \"page\" $page \"menuEntries\" .) }}\n    \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/nav\u003e\n{{- end }}\n\n{{- define \"partials/inline/menu/walk.html\" }}\n  {{- $page := .page }}\n  {{- range .menuEntries }}\n    {{- $attrs := dict \"href\" .URL }}\n    {{- if $page.IsMenuCurrent .Menu . }}\n      {{- $attrs = merge $attrs (dict \"class\" \"active\" \"aria-current\" \"page\") }}\n    {{- else if $page.HasMenuCurrent .Menu .}}\n      {{- $attrs = merge $attrs (dict \"class\" \"ancestor\" \"aria-current\" \"true\") }}\n    {{- end }}\n\n    \u003c!-- Opening Tag --\u003e\n    {{- if .HasChildren }}\n      \u003c!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details --\u003e\n      \u003c!-- Details creates collapsing section --\u003e\n        \u003cdetails role=\"menu\"\u003e\n    {{- else }}\n      \u003c!-- If no children, it's a list item --\u003e\n        \u003cli\u003e\n    {{- end}}\n     \u003c!-- Summary is used to display the text for \u003cdetails\u003e --\u003e\n      \u003csummary\u003e\n        \u003ca tabindex=\"0\"\n          {{- range $k, $v := $attrs }}\n            {{- with $v }}\n              {{- printf \" %s=%q\" $k $v | safeHTMLAttr }}\n            {{- end }}\n          {{- end -}}\n        \u003e{{ or (T .Identifier) .Name | safeHTML }}\u003c/a\u003e\n      \u003c/summary\u003e\n      {{- with .Children }}\n        \u003cul class=\"childMenu\"\u003e\n          {{- partial \"inline/menu/walk.html\" (dict \"page\" $page \"menuEntries\" .) }}\n        \u003c/ul\u003e\n      {{- end }}\n      {{- if .HasChildren }}\n    \u003c/label\u003e\n    {{- end}}\n\n    \u003c!-- Closing Tag --\u003e\n    {{- if .HasChildren }}\n      \u003c/details\u003e\n    {{- else }}\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n    {{- end }}\n\n\n  {{- end }}\n{{- end }}\n```\n\n\n## Include `sidebar.html` partial in layout\nExample modified `layouts/index.html`\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang=\"{{ .Lang }}\"\u003e\n{{ partial \"head.html\" . }}\n\n\u003cbody\u003e\n  {{partial \"search.html\" .}}\n  \u003cdiv class=\"singlePage\"\u003e\n    \u003c!-- Add your sidebar here. --\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"sidebar\"\u003e\n      {{ partial \"menu.html\" (dict \"menuID\" \"main\" \"page\" .) }}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\n      \u003c!-- Begin actual content --\u003e\n      {{partial \"header.html\" .}}\n      \u003carticle\u003e\n        {{partial \"toc.html\" .}}\n        {{partial \"textprocessing.html\" . }}\n        {{if $.Site.Data.config.enableRecentNotes}}\n        {{partial \"recent.html\" . }}\n        {{end}}\n      \u003c/article\u003e\n      {{partial \"footerIndex.html\" .}}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## Create `assets/styles/sidebar.scss`\nHere's some example CSS for the dropdown menu. It's styled similar to the Obsidian sidebar.\n\n```scss\n.sidebar {\n  width: 100%;\n  flex: 1 0 auto;\n}\n\n.menu {\n  padding-left: 2px;\n  list-style-type: disc;\n  font-size: .9em;\n}\n\n.menu \u003e ul {\n  padding: 0;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\nli.hasChildren {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.childMenu {\n  padding-left: 24px;\n  font-size: .9em;\n}\n\n.childMenu li a[aria-current=\"page\"] {\n  color: var(--primary);\n}\n.childMenu li {\n  position: relative;\n  list-style-type: none;\n}\n\n.childMenu li:hover::before {\n  background-color: var(--dark);\n}\n\n.childMenu li::before{\n  content: '';\n  width: 2px;\n  height: 90%;\n  position: absolute;\n  left: -10px;\n  background-color: var(--outlinegray);\n}\n```\n\n## Add pages to Sidebar in metadata\nUnfortunately, this is not an automatic process. You must add pages to the Sidebar using metadata. This is very straightforward, though.\n\nFor example, if we have a folder called \"Notes\", and a page called \"Sidebar in Quartz\", we would modify the `content/notes/Sidebar in Quartz.md` and add the following to metadata:\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: Sidebar in Quartz\n\ntags:\n- code\n- quartz\n- obsidian\n\nmenu:\n    main:\n        params:\n        parent: Notes\n---\n\n# Sidebar in Quartz\nblahblahblah\n```\n\nYou would do this for every page that you want included in the menu. Another alternative is to just modify the layout html and hardcode a menu. \n\nHappy Quartz-ing.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T21:32:30.976885069Z","tags":["code","quartz","obsidian"]},"/notes/bagels-in-the-desert":{"title":"Make bagels in the desert","content":"\nI use this bagel recipe:\n[[recipes/bagels|bagels]]\n\nFebrurary 2023, at [Mars College](https://mars.college/).

Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast and sugar mixture.  \n  \n3. Pour `1/3 cup / 80ml` of the remaining warm water into the well. Mix and stir in the rest of the water as needed.\n    - Depending on where you live, you may need to add anywhere from a couple tablespoons to about `¼ cup/60ml` of water. You want a moist and firm dough after you have mixed it.  \n  \n4. On a floured countertop, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.\n    - Try working in as much flour as possible to form a firm and stiff dough.  \n  \n#### Let Dough Rise\n5. Lightly brush a large bowl with oil and turn the dough to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp dish towel.\n    - **[Bake Later]** Put the bowl in the fridge. Take out 1.5 hours before baking. Follow [Bake Now] instruction.\n    - **[Bake Now]** Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size. Punch the dough down, and let it rest for another 10 minutes.  \n\n#### Pre-Shape of Dough\n6. Divide dough in to 8 equal pieces.\n    1. Shape each piece into a round.\n    2. Use the counter top and your palm to pull the dough in to tighter rounds. See [this video by ChainBaker at 00:52 on pre-shaping technique](https://youtu.be/VoxMz0_j7yw?t=52).\n    3. Let rounds rest on counter for a few minutes. Usually by the time you are done with the last one, the first is ready for final shaping.\n\n#### Final Shape of Dough\n7. Coat a finger in flour, and gently press your finger into the center of each dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about ⅓ the diameter of the bagel and place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Repeat the same step with the remaining dough.  \n\n#### Cookie Sheet Rest\n8. After shaping the dough rounds and placing them on the cookie sheet, cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, \n  \n#### Prep for Bake\n9. Preheat oven to to 425ºF / 220ºC.\n\n#### Boil\n10. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Reduce the heat. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to lower the bagels into the water. Boil as many as you are comfortable with boiling. Once the bagels are in, it shouldn’t take too long for them to float to the top (a couple seconds). Let them sit there for 1 minute, and them flip them over to boil for another minute. Extend the boiling times to 2 minutes each, if you’d prefer a chewier bagel (results will give you a more New York Style bagel with this option).  \n  \n#### Add Toppings\n10. If you want to add toppings to your bagels, do so as you take them out of the water, you may use the “optional toppings” (listed below) to top the bagels and if you’re risky like me, make a combination of the toppings to top the bagels with. However, before hand, you will need to use an egg wash to get the toppings to stick before putting the bagels into the oven.  \n\n#### Bake em!\n11. Once all the bagels have boiled (and have been topped with your choice of toppings), transfer them to an oiled or parchment-lined baking sheet.  \n  \n12. Bake for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown (I usually err on the side of 20 minutes).  \n  \n13. Cool on a wire rack.\n\n#### Eat em!\n14. While they are in the oven, get your schmears and spreads and toppings ready. I like cream cheese, tomato, thinly sliced red onion, avocado, salt and pepper. Or just eat it with some butter. Or just by itself. Make sure to eat them while hot!\n\n#### Save em.\n15. When cooled, slice bagels in half, then put in freezer in a freezer safe bag/container. Reheat in toaster or oven when a bagel is needed.","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T21:32:30.980885137Z","tags":["food","bagels"]}}
